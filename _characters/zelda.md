Princess Zelda (pronounced /ˈzɛldə/ ZEL-də)[9] is the eponymous name commonly given to the females born into the Royal Family of
 Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda series.[10] With the exception of Link's Awakening, Majora's Mask, and Tri Force Heroes, an incarnation
  of Zelda or one of her alter egos has always been one of the central characters in the series.

Each incarnation of Zelda has been shown at various ages depending upon which title they appear in. They have appeared as a child,
 a teenager and as a young adult; for example, the Princess Zelda in Twilight Princess is around 20 years of age.[11]

Early on in the timeline of the series, the original Zelda, while born as a Hylian, is the mortal incarnation of the Goddess Hylia.[12]
 Carrying on this divine blood, her female descendants are often named after her and are always the crown princess of Hyrule throughout
  its history.[1][2][13][14][15] Several princesses within the bloodline are also the possessor of the Triforce of Wisdom,
  imbued with the essence of the Goddess Nayru.[1][16][17] The essence of Nayru affords each Zelda divine wisdom, allowing them to
  discern the wisest decisions, especially in situations concerning the welfare of Hyrule. It grants them a myriad of mystical abilities,
   including the ability to heal others, though there is a possibility that this could also be an effect of their bloodline passing
   down Hylia's own powers and, later, the Light Force.
