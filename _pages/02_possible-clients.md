This is a page that on the real site lists some things that they can help with/people they want to work with.

There will be an accordion on this page with snippets about the sages (Ie, Ruto is a Zora, and the sage of water).
I'm not sure how I'm going to scaffold this out.

Down here will be a block that basically asks if you are qualified to be a sage or whatever.
